# Acute Stroke Prediction System
___

#### Abstract

The proposed system estimates a multivariate Gaussian distribution of diffusion tensor features in a set of brain regions.

Based on endogenous optical scattering signals provided by OCT imaging, I have developed a single, integrated imaging platform enabling the measurement of changes in blood perfusion, blood flow,erythrocyte velocity, and light attenuation within cortical tissue, during focal cerebral ischemia in a mouse model.

The use of multi-parametric OCT imaging may aid in the comprehensive evaluation of ischemic lesions during the early stages of stroke, thereby providing essential knowledge for guiding treatment decisions.

#### Problem Statement

- As we know Brain Stroke is a very serious medical condition and diagnosing it
is also difficult.

- It takes a lot of time for a doctor to analyse each and every patient who is having
a trouble in his Brain.

- So my algorithm predicts if the patient is more likely to have a stroke based on
the patientâ€™s OCT Images.
